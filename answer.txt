Q1:How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
addr_info = socket.getaddrinfo(HOST, PORT, proto=socket.SOL_TCP)

Q2:What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
For client socket, we create socket using s = socket.socket(family,socketype, proto)
For server socket, we create socket using s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Q3:How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

Q4:What information do we get about incoming connections?
('127.0.0.1', 33730), we can get these imformation by using this code:
conn, addr = s.accept() 
print(addr)

Q5:What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
The data returned from google
